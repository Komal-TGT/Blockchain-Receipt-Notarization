# 📜 Blockchain Receipt Notary

A decentralized application (dApp) that stores and verifies digital receipt hashes on the Polygon Amoy Testnet.  
Built with **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, **Ethers.js**, and **Node.js**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Publish a receipt hash to the blockchain for proof of authenticity.
- Verify if a receipt hash already exists on-chain.
- Uses **Polygon Amoy Testnet** for testing.
- Backend integration with **Node.js** and **Ethers.js**.
- Configurable via environment variables.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Komal-TGT/Blockchain-Receipt-Notarization.git
cd blockchain-receipt-notary
2️⃣ Install Dependencies

npm install
3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:

ALCHEMY_RPC_URL="https://polygon-amoy.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY"
PRIVATE_KEY="your-wallet-private-key"
NOTARY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="your-deployed-contract-address"
⚠️ Never commit your .env file to GitHub.

4️⃣ Compile the Smart Contract

npx hardhat compile
5️⃣ Deploy to Polygon Amoy

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network amoy
Copy the deployed contract address from the terminal and update .env.
🔗 Interacting with the Contract
Publish a Receipt Hash
javascript

const tx = await contract.publishToChain(receiptHash);
await tx.wait();
console.log("Receipt hash published!");
Verify a Receipt Hash
javascript

const exists = await contract.verifyHash(receiptHash);
console.log("Exists on-chain:", exists);
📜 Contract Verification (Optional)
To verify your contract on Polygonscan:


npx hardhat verify --network amoy <contract-address>
